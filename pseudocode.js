//Set up folder and document structure -- complete

//Set up test files for each Employee type - Employee, Engineer, Manager, Intern

//Figure out what to test for each test file

//Set up parent class for Employees

//Build out questions for the manager to answer

//Test that the manager's object was created from the class with the correct data

//Create a basic HTML structure of the cards

//Build out the manager card with manager object dynamically

//Next work on Engineer object based on user input

//Next work on Intern object based on user input

//NOTE: going to need a function that generates the HTML - can use template literals - have one js file for this and export function to generate entire page

//NOTE: for the main index js file, import all classes, create an empty array for teamMembers and idArray

//NOTE: grab input for manager and call that class to create an object, then call another function to create team. For this function use a switch statement to determine whether the user wants to create an engineer or intern and call the appropriate functions in cases

//NOTE: Finally, call a function if they don't want to create any more team members and call the function to render the HTML to build the team
